# A Bulk RNA-seq Pipeline for Count Matrix Generation

RNA-seq has become a ubiquitous tool for gaining insight into the transcriptomes of diverse organisms. 

In this tutorial, you will learn how to write an RNA-sequencing pipeline that ingests FastQ samples and return count matrices, using the Latch SDK. 

## Prerequisites: 
* Install the Latch SDK.
* Understand basic concepts of a workflow through our Quickstart and Authoring your Own Workflow. 

## What You Will Learn

This end-to-end tutorial will demonstrate the following concepts:
